Well this is particularly cool.
I go looking for my private gitlab instance to download a copy of the repoes, and I've not initialized it after installing it.
And I go looking for the copy of the repoes I'm sure I made before smashing the old server, and it's gone too.
The good news is that I have so many backups of the projects on disk that nothing is really lost; it's just that I'm going to have a real headache getting things put back as they were meant to already be. For the minute, for streak maintenance, I think I'll just be keeping a baby journal of how that process is going; I'm terrified I'll break something what with the submodule tool I was using. <sub>seriously, how did i get backups of the sql databases and not the gitlab instance...</sub>

Bad news is that I couldn't find any of the project exports I could've sworn that I'd kept. Good news is that I still had source files and git directories, so I was able to restore everything that I might've lost. We'll pick this up again tomorrow I think. :stress:
