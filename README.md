Well this is particularly cool.
I go looking for my private gitlab instance to download a copy of the repoes, and I've not initialized it after installing it.
And I go looking for the copy of the repoes I'm sure I made before smashing the old server, and it's gone too.
The good news is that I have so many backups of the projects on disk that nothing is really lost; it's just that I'm going to have a real headache getting things put back as they were meant to already be. For the minute, for streak maintenance, I think I'll just be keeping a baby journal of how that process is going; I'm terrified I'll break something what with the submodule tool I was using. <sub>seriously, how did i get backups of the sql databases and not the gitlab instance...</sub>

Bad news is that I couldn't find any of the project exports I could've sworn that I'd kept. Good news is that I still had source files and git directories, so I was able to restore everything that I might've lost. We'll pick this up again tomorrow I think. :stress:

Sweet! Found it all, got the repoes fixed with the latest gitlab deployment, fixed the submodule linkage. My big project is saved! Now I can work on this. Just gonna quickly take a couple more notes about how that happened for next time because this gitlab deployment is already on the verge of being phased out, and then I can make a gitignore for the base files and the refactoring can begin!

It is an incredibly demoralizing thing to look at your own codebase, something you spent 6 hours a day working on every day for two years, and not be able to know what half of it does or why. It's even worse when you go to try just making something from scratch and to realize you can't even remember how to link a stylesheet to a website. Two years away really does have a cost to it. And boy does it sting.
